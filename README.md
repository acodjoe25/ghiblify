Project overview:
We employed convolutional neural networks to implement an image - style transfer algorithm, leveraging built-inframeworks such as VGG-19 models and pytorch. We produced informational analytics delineating model loss over training

Please note that this project of these have been transitioned from its original form (google built-in codelab) such that it can be easily visable. We chose to implement within this scope as it was easier to maintain the deep learning model.

Shell
I constructed a shell, allowing users to run both built-in commands and foreign porgrams
Implemented features such as command history, job control, signal handling, and resource reaping.

Server
At a high level, the program creates a server that takes in two different kinds of http requests from users:broadband requests which access the census API or csv requests (loadcsv, viewcsv, or searchcsv) which load, view, and searcha passed in csv file.

Malloc 
I designed and implemented malloc and free, showing an indepth understanding of software systems.# ghiblify
