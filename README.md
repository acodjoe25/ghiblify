Project overview:
We employed convolutional neural networks to implement an image - style transfer algorithm, leveraging built-inframeworks such as VGG-19 models and pytorch. We produced informational analytics delineating model loss over training

Please note that this project of these have been transitioned from its original form (google built-in codelab) such that it can be easily visable. We chose to implement within this scope as it was easier to maintain the deep learning model.
