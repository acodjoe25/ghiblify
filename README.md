Welcome to my portfolio. Here, one can see some of my projects. Please note that many of these have been transitioned from their original form such that it can be easily visable. Conract me at ariana_codjoe@brown.edu for questions. Below, I have detailed short descirptions.

Ghibligy
I employed convolutional neural networks to implement an image - style transfer algorithm, leveraging built-inframeworks such as VGG-19 models and pytorch. I produced informational analytics delineating model loss over training

Shell
I constructed a shell, allowing users to run both built-in commands and foreign porgrams
Implemented features such as command history, job control, signal handling, and resource reaping.

Server
At a high level, the program creates a server that takes in two different kinds of http requests from users:broadband requests which access the census API or csv requests (loadcsv, viewcsv, or searchcsv) which load, view, and searcha passed in csv file.

Malloc 
I designed and implemented malloc and free, showing an indepth understanding of software systems.# ghiblify
